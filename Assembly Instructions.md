<H2>Assembly Instructions</H2>
To assemble the Robotan board, you'll need the <A HREF="schematics">plain board</A> itself plus:  
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>1 x Wemos D1 Mini
<LI>1 x MAX 3232 CPE DIP 16 RS232/TTL converter
<LI>1 x 9 pin male serial connector
<LI>5 x 0.1µF capacitators
<LI>2 x 8 pin header
<LI>2 x 8 pin socket
  </UL>
Except for the Wemos D1 Mini, you can find a list of items at <A HREF="https://www.reichelt.de/my/1409494">Reichelt</A>.  
Some boards from a collective order are still available. Contact robotan (ät) code-it.de if you are interested (German or English).

Then proceed as follows:
<BR>

1. Solder the two 8 pin sockets to the Wemos D1 mini and the two 8 pin headers on the Robotan board.

2. Solder the MAX 3232 CPE on the board.

3. Solder the five capacitators on the board

4. Solder the serial connector to the board. You might have to bend the two adjacent capacitators a bit.

5. Plug the Robotan board on top of the Wemos D1 Mini. The serial connector of the Robotan board must be on the same side as the Micro USB 
connector of the Wemos D1 Mini.

<H3>Done :-)!</H3>
