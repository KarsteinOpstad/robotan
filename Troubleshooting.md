<H3>Troubleshooting</H3>
<H2>I'm asked for a username and password!</H2>
The username is "Robotan", the password is "Robotan88" (of course without quotation marks)
<H2>I can't open the Robotan website</H2>
There could be several reasons:
1. Make sure Robotan and you are in the same WiFi network. If you have configured Robotan to use your own network, but in the list of
WiFi networks, a network called "Robotan" still shows up, that means that Robotan was unable to connect to your WiFi network.
Connect to the Robotan WiFi network and check the configuration.

2. You are too far away from the robot. Get closer and try again. If this occurs in large(r) parts of your garden, you might want to get 
a WiFi repeater.
