Installaion of the Robotan board is pretty straightforward, but please take note that because this is not an official Zucchetti product,
YOU WILL LOSE YOUR WARRANTY. So please proceed only if you are aware of this fact!

Photos shown are from a Herkules Wiper Ciiky XH2 (same model as Ambrogio L30 or Stiga Autoclip 228S), so if you have a different model,
the location of the screws might be different. Ask your dealer or in a forum if you are not sure!

<H3>Opening the robot</H3>
First, turn the robot around so you can see the bottom and locate the two plastic covers at the bottom of the robot which cover the bottom screws:

Then remove these plastic covers with a flat screwdriver. Be extra careful not to cut yourself by touching the robot blades!

Now remove the two screws. They might not come out completely, that's ok.

Now turn the robot back around and locate the two Torx screws at the back of the robot and remove them.
They might not come out completely, but that's ok. You just need to be able to press the two buttons above the screws to lift the cover.
Take care not to open the cover too wide, otherwise some of the connector cables will come off. Opening it 5-10 centimeters is enough.

<H3>Installing the Robotan module</H3>

Locate the bluetooth module if installed, otherwise proceed to the next step. Remove the bluetooth module and keep it in a safe place.
You'll need it in the future in case you want to do a firmware update of the robot via bluetooth.  
To remove the module, you have to remove two screws which fixate the module to the robot's mainboard. They are right under the round holes
of the module (see blue arrows):

Locate the empty serial port and insert the Robotan module. If the module does
not fit in your robot because other parts are standing in the way, you might
want to use an <A HREF="https://www.reichelt.de/Adapter-Gender-Changer/DELOCK-65593/3/index.html?GROUPID=6062&ARTICLE=157596">adapter</A> and/or
an <A HREF="https://www.reichelt.de/Sub-D-Kabel/DELOCK-84064/3/index.html?ARTICLE=179872&GROUPID=6082">extension cable</A>
in order to connect the module properly.

If you want, you can use the screws of the bluetooth module to also fixate the Robotan module:
