  <H3>Why is the source code of Robotan not available?</H3>
  As you can see with my other projects, I'm a supporter of open source software. However, with this project, I had to figure out how the app and the robot communicate with each other. This is legal (at least here in Germany), but it may not be legal to tell the world how this protocol works. And this would be the case if I make the source code available, because everyone (with a little bit of programming knowledge) would be able to find out in no time. And as I'm the type of guy who rather is safe than sorry, the core Robotan program can only be downloaded as bin image.
